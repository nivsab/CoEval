**[CoEval: Ranking Language Models for Custom Tasks Without Labeled Data or Trustworthy Benchmarks](https://apartsinprojects.github.io/CoEval/)** — read it online (HTML with rendered math) or download the [Word version](https://github.com/ApartsinProjects/CoEval/raw/master/docs/paper/CoEval.docx).

*Alexander Apartsin (Holon Institute of Technology) · Yehudit Aperstein (Afeka Tel Aviv Academic College of Engineering)*

CoEval ranks models for a custom task or domain in the hardest setting: when **no task-specific labeled data** exists and **public benchmarks cannot be trusted** because their items have likely leaked into pretraining. From only a task description, a teacher model synthesizes a fresh, contamination-free benchmark and a cross-family judge ensemble ranks the candidates, with no human labels or raters.

| Result | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Recovers the **true model ranking** with no labeled data | Spearman ρ = 0.86 vs ground-truth correctness, 95% CI [0.77, 0.94] |
| Cancels a **verbosity bias no single judge avoids** | ensemble *r* = +0.010 (CI spans zero), a 93% reduction |
| **Composition over size**: panel diversity, not panel size, drives reliability | ICC(3,*k*) peaks at two well-chosen judges, falls as low-agreement judges are added |
| Structurally precludes **same-family self-preference** | vendor-disjoint panel; aggregation shifts every score ≤ 0.015 |
| **Contamination-free** generated items | 0.0000 verbatim 13-gram overlap with five major public benchmarks |
| **Inexpensive** enough to re-run per model release | 7,978 evaluations for USD 5.89, fully automated |

## 🚨 The Challenge

**Evaluating and selecting off-the-shelf or fine-tuned models for a specific use case is difficult.**

Choosing the right LLM means navigating a minefield of hidden pitfalls:

|     | Challenge                                                      | Why It Hurts                                                                                                          |
|:---:|:-------------------------------------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎯  | **Generic benchmarks don't transfer**                          | Public data and metrics often miss the nuances of *your* real-world requirements.                                     |
| 🧩  | **Custom benchmarks are hard to design**                       | Defining representative tasks, building rubrics, and choosing robustness variations is non-trivial.                   |
| 💸  | **Multi-model multi-task benchmarks are expensive to execute** | Running every candidate model across every task and rubric quickly multiplies cost and compute.                       |
| 🕳️ | **Leakage biases results**                                     | Public and private benchmark items (or near-duplicates) may lurk in training data, inflating scores via memorization. |
| ⚙️  | **Ops and cost are complex**                                   | Running evaluations across providers, inference modes, and scoring criteria demands careful orchestration.            |

> **Bottom line:** You can't trust a leaderboard number, and building your own eval is a project in itself.

## 💡 The Concept

**Ensemble-based synthetic self-evaluation benchmarking** — let the models evaluate *each other*.

CoEval generates a synthetic evaluation suite spanning multiple domain-specific tasks and scoring rubrics, then assembles an **ensemble of models** that rotate through three roles:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     MODEL  ENSEMBLE                         │
│                                                             │
│   ┌───────────┐    ┌───────────┐    ┌───────────┐          │
│   │  Model A   │    │  Model B   │    │  Model C   │  ...   │
│   └─────┬─────┘    └─────┬─────┘    └─────┬─────┘          │
│         │                │                │                 │
│         ▼                ▼                ▼                 │
│   ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓     │
│   ┃          ROTATING  ROLE  ASSIGNMENT               ┃     │
│   ┗━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━┛     │
│              ▼                ▼                  ▼           │
│      🎓 TEACHER        📝 STUDENT          ⚖️ JUDGE        │
│   Generate synthetic   Models under       Score outputs     │
│   challenges &         evaluation take    against the       │
│   reference answers    the challenges     rubric            │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Reliability through selection

Not all teachers and judges are created equal. CoEval improves signal quality by identifying:

| Role           | Selection Criterion                                                         | Intuition                                    |
|:--------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------- |
| 🎓 **Teacher** | **Differentiating** — produces challenges that separate student performance | A good exam question reveals who studied.    |
| ⚖️ **Judge**   | **Consensus** — high agreement with ensemble majority                       | A reliable judge aligns with peer consensus. |

### Flexible provisioning

```
  Fully Automatic          Semi-Automatic               Manual
  ┌────────────┐          ┌────────────────┐        ┌──────────────┐
  │ Tasks       │          │ Tasks ✏️       │        │ Tasks ✏️      │
  │ Rubrics     │  ──►     │ Rubrics        │  ──►   │ Rubrics ✏️    │
  │ Attr. Space │          │ Attr. Space ✏️ │        │ Attr. Space ✏️│
  └────────────┘          └────────────────┘        └──────────────┘
   AI-generated            Human-guided               Human-defined
```

Tasks, rubrics, and diversity/attribute spaces can be provisioned **fully automatically**, **semi-automatically** (human-in-the-loop), or **manually** — choose the level of control that fits your workflow.

### 16 Model Interfaces

| Cloud — Async Batch ✅ | Cloud — Real-time | OpenAI-Compatible | Local / Virtual |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `openai` | `azure_openai`¹ | `groq` | `huggingface` |
| `anthropic` | `azure_ai` | `deepseek` | `ollama` |
| `gemini`² | `bedrock` | `mistral` | `benchmark` |
| | `vertex` | `deepinfra` | |
| | `openrouter` | `cerebras` | |

> ¹ `azure_openai` supports Azure Global Batch API (50% discount) — enable via `batch: azure_openai:` in config.
> ² `gemini` uses concurrent requests (pseudo-batch) — no async discount.

### Key Capabilities

| Capability | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost estimation** | Itemised call budget and cost table before any phases run; Batch API discounts modelled |
| **Batch API** | 50% async discount for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Azure OpenAI; Gemini uses concurrent mode (no discount) |
| **Resume** | `--continue` resumes at exact JSONL record; no duplicate API calls |
| **Auto attributes** | Teachers infer task dimensions from a description; no hand-labelling required |
| **Auto rubric** | Teachers propose rubric factors; merge-and-deduplicate across N teachers |
| **Multi-judge ensemble** | N judges → bias-resistant aggregate scores; outlier judges down-weighted |
| **8 HTML reports** | Interactive charts, filterable tables, CSV export, fully self-contained (no CDN) |
| **Model probe** | Verify all 16 interfaces are reachable before spending a dollar |
| **Virtual teachers** | Pre-ingested public datasets supply zero-cost Phase 3 ground truth |
| **Label accuracy** | Judge-free exact-match for classification tasks (`label_attributes`) |
